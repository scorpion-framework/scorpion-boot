Application maker for the [Scorpion Framework](https://github.com/scorpion-framwork/scorpion)

Usage
=====

To use scorpion-boot simply add it your dub.sdl or dub.json as a dependency

```sdl
name "my-application"
dependency "scorpion-boot" version="..."
```

```json
{
	"name": "my-application",
	"dependencies": {
		"scorpion-boot": "..."
	}
}
```

Note that scorpion-boot doesn't have scorpion as dependency and you have to add it manually.
